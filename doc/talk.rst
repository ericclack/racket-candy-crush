Why learn Racket? Why teach Racket? 
-----------------------------------

Let's compare it to Python, and Pygame Zero with the Mu editor. Kids
coming from Scratch and trying a text-based language for the first
time.

Observations on Python
----------------------

Kids are really motivated.

Quick results with little code.

They don't often understand what they are doing, but it seems to work.

Brackets, commas, quotes are confusing.

Nested things are confusing, such as if-statements containing anything
beyond the simplest statement. Both the concept of this work happens
inside this conditional, and the indentation.

Poor concept of functions.

Often functions do something to the world and it is hard to know when
to call them.
