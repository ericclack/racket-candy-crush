Why learn Racket?
=================

Who might learn Racket?
-----------------------

Kids at code clubs, when wondering what to move up to after a visual
programming language like `Scratch`_. They might be 10-16 years old.

Curious high school or college students, who want to explore more than
the mainstream languages such as Python. 14-18 years old.

University students?

Professional programmers?

Amateur programmers, programming tourists.

Why would they do this?
-----------------------

We (Racket fans) might say: "You should learn a Lisp". As others have
said it will lead to "profound enlightenment".






Where's your proof?
